Description: 'A set of three binary classifiers (random forest, gradient boosting
  classifier, and logistic regression) to predict the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability
  of small organic compounds. The best models were applied to natural products of
  marine origin, able to inhibit kinases associated with neurodegenerative disorders.
  The training set size was around 300 compounds.
